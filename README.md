With the help of cursor, claude and deepseek, I try to make some  ai tools

#AI chatbot Project
灵感源于我想要开发一款对标多邻国的语言学习app，需要融合ai功能，口语练习chatbot是一个不能缺少的功能，这个chatbot是一个很粗糙的最小mvp产品，无需调用api，call本地部署的大模型，能够以一个语言老师的预设与用户对话，支持随时打断对话
The inspiration comes from the fact that I want to develop a language learning app that benchmarks multiple neighboring countries and needs to incorporate ai functionality, and a chatbot for speaking practice is an indispensable feature. The chatbot is a very rough minimal mvp product that does not need to call an api, and calls a locally deployed big model that is able to talk to the user with the predefined settings of a language teacher, and supports interrupting the conversation at any time. 

#AI辩论
简单写了个ai辩论小工具，只要自己配制好api key，可以调用市面上任何主流的模型的各种版本进行辩论，功能实现上并不难，后续想加上UI界面和更多有意思的玩法，比如语音，幻想着ai数字人或机器人或许真的有一天能够表演奇葩说那样的节目哈哈哈
Simply write an ai debate gadget, as long as they formulate a good api key, you can call any mainstream model on the market for the various versions of the debate, the function is not difficult to realize, the follow-up would like to add the UI interface and more interesting to play, such as voice.
