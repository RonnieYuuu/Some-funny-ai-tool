#AI chatbot Project
灵感源于我想要开发一款对标多邻国的语言学习app，需要融合ai功能，口语练习chatbot是一个不能缺少的功能，这个chatbot是一个很粗糙的最小mvp产品，无需调用api，call本地部署的大模型，能够以一个语言老师的预设与用户对话，支持随时打断对话
The inspiration comes from the fact that I want to develop a language learning app that benchmarks multiple neighboring countries and needs to incorporate ai functionality, and a chatbot for speaking practice is an indispensable feature. The chatbot is a very rough minimal mvp product that does not need to call an api, and calls a locally deployed big model that is able to talk to the user with the predefined settings of a language teacher, and supports interrupting the conversation at any time.
