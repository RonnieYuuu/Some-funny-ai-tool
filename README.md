With the help of cursor, claude and deepseek, I try to make some  ai tools

#AI chatbot Project
灵感源于我想要开发一款对标多邻国的语言学习app，需要融合ai功能，口语练习chatbot是一个不能缺少的功能，这个chatbot是一个很粗糙的最小mvp产品，无需调用api，call本地部署的大模型，能够以一个语言老师的预设与用户对话，支持随时打断对话（美中不足是我目前能力有限，开发不了出色的前端交互界面，也还不太明白后端比如数据存储之类的怎么实现，因为我希望它最终能够根据每一次的对话生成完备的语法语音评估报告，并记录在学习app中）
The inspiration comes from the fact that I want to develop a language learning app that benchmarks multiple neighboring countries and needs to incorporate ai functionality, and a chatbot for speaking practice is an indispensable feature. The chatbot is a very rough minimal mvp product that does not need to call an api, and calls a locally deployed big model that is able to talk to the user with the predefined settings of a language teacher, and supports interrupting the conversation at any time. The downside is that I'm currently limited in my ability to develop a good front-end interface, and I don't really understand how to implement the back-end data storage, because I want it to be able to generate a complete grammar and speech evaluation report based on each conversation and record it in the learning app).
